                <h2 class="about wrapper">About Me(ghan)</h2>
                <p class="about wrapper">Meghan Rennie is often an artist, sometimes a facilitator, and hopefully
                    always
                    a
                    friend. She is enamoured with humanity and passionate about projects: she currently dabbles in
                    printmaking, zines/DIY publishing, graphic design, music-making, and comics. She often writes
                    about
                    herself in the third person. </p>
                <p class="about wrapper"> What would you like to know about her?</p>
            </div>

                <h2 class="about wrapper">Creative Practice</h2>
                <p class="about wrapper">Meghan Rennie has a lazy Susan of creative interests, which she spins and
                    samples from rather chaotically. Her artistic “career” began at sixteen, when she started her
                    own
                    business (SunSoft Art) selling pinback buttons and linocut greeting cards. For every five cards
                    sold, she wrote a personal message in one and sent it to a family at the Northern Alberta Ronald
                    McDonald House.
                </p>
                <p class="about wrapper">Around this time, she also started writing and recording songs and sharing
                    her
                    music online. Originally, this was under the project title Be Kind to Dogs, though she has since
                    switched to performing under her own name. As a musician, she has performed at The Verge Arts
                    Festival in Cold Lake and at Arts Days events in Lethbridge, and has been on the award-winning
                    CKXU
                    show For the Record. Additionally, she created the intro/outro music for the podcast Excuses to
                    Connect.
                </p>
                <p class="about wrapper">Meghan’s involvement in the music scene goes beyond writing and performing
                    songs. She has a minor in music marketing and management from Hogeschool Utrecht in the
                    Netherlands,
                    and she often volunteers with CKXU Radio Society in roles varying from show host to president of
                    the
                    board of directors. </p>
                <p class="about wrapper">Between other projects, Meghan keeps busy. She undertakes the occasional
                    graphic
                    design commission, creating logos and designing print publications. She makes comics, usually as
                    mini-zines which she disseminates around town. She also writes: her poetry and prose fiction has
                    appeared in multiple publications, including The Blue Marble Review, The Meliorist, Pulp Kings,
                    and
                    Sad Girl Reviews, and her one-act dark comedy, It’s a Dead Body!, was performed at the 2019
                    Verge
                    Arts Festival. Her academic writing has been accepted into international marketing conferences.

                <h2 class="about wrapper">Personal Life</h2>
                <p class="about wrapper">Meghan Rennie has no hometown. As a military brat, she was born on Elmendorf
                    Air
                    Force Base in Alaska, spent her childhood moving every two years, then lived through an angsty
                    adolescence in Cold Lake, Alberta. She is currently pursuing a combined bachelor’s degree in General
                    Management and New Media at the University of Lethbridge. </p>
                <p class="about wrapper">Meghan is a generally busy person who always has a handful of projects
                    in-progress, though she’s trying to be less of a workaholic about it all. She collects buttons and
                    pins, patterned socks, zines, and vintage Garfield merchandise. <a id="french">She can speak French,
                        though honestly it’s much easier t write than to speak</a>; <a id="dutch">her Dutch is bad, but
                        she does her best.</a> Her life goals are to make art, make friends, and be kinder to herself.

                <h2 class="about wrapper">Artist Statement</h2>
                <p class="about wrapper">Iterative processes soothe her perfectionist tendencies. She likes practice
                    rounds,
                    second chances, and opportunities to improve.
                </p>
                <p class="about wrapper">She’s oriented around collection and categorisation. She likes curating,
                    compiling,
                    and collaging elements to form a new whole. She revels in mixing fiction and non-fiction, and in
                    building rules for new realities. </p>
                <p class="about wrapper">Physical media is incredibly important to her. She loves everything that’s
                    real,
                    hand-holdable, and unavoidable—impossible to lose in the digital deluge. She wants something
                    right
                    in
                    front of her, in front of you. </p>
                <p class="about wrapper">Her personal tastes tend towards maximalism. She wants colours and patterns and
                    noise—cartoons and hallucinations and synaesthesia—verbose visual language.</p>
